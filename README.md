This password generator will generate a unique password for you given that it needs to have at least one:
- lower case letter
- upper case letter
- numerric value
- special character

With this logic, I created a system that will always have at least one and will also store these values in a text
file where it will be easy to navigate to and find all of your passwords in one place.

You can also override a password for a platform that you already have determined in the .txt file by entering the
same platform in the input

This program:
- Creates a unique, randomly generated, 12 character password
- Satisifes all password requirements for virtually every platform
- Will store any and all passwords in an easy-to-find .txt file
